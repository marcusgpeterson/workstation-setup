Workstation Setup (OS X 10.10)
===============
Rapidly provision a local OS X Yosemite development environment using [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/), [chef-solo](https://docs.chef.io/chef_solo.html), and [Soloist](https://github.com/mkocher/soloist).

Wherever possible, the included recipes invoke [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/) under the hood.

This approach to provisioning a development environment was heavily inspired by Pivotal Labs' [Pivotal Sprout Project](https://github.com/pivotal-sprout).

Dependencies: Ruby, Homebrew, Xcode CLI tools
